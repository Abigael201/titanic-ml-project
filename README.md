# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

## Description
This repository contains my solution for the Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster Kaggle competition. The goal is to predict passenger survival using various machine learning techniques.

## Key Insights
- **Data Exploration:** Significant patterns were observed in survival rates based on age, sex, and passenger class.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Missing values were handled, and categorical variables were encoded to prepare the data for modeling.
- **Model Building:** Various models, including Logistic Regression and Random Forest, were trained and evaluated.
- **Evaluation:** The best model achieved an accuracy of X% on the test set. Feature importance analysis highlighted the most impactful variables.
- **Conclusion:** The project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to a real-world classification problem, with a focus on data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset files (`train.csv` and `test.csv`).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with detailed analysis and model building.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:
1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/Abigael201/titanic-ml-project.git`
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the notebook:** Open the notebook in Google Colab to reproduce the analysis.
